# Flag Trainer

Flag Trainer is a simple web application that helps users learn and recognize flags from around the world. The app displays a random flag and four country options, and the user must select the correct country that the flag belongs to. If the user answers correctly, the flag is removed from the pool. If the user answers incorrectly, the flag remains in the pool and may be shown again.
